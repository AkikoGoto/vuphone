= Introduction =

Feel free to toss up any ideas you have for VU apps - either edit the page, or put them in the comments. 


= Details =

Vandy Vans 
  * See VV route info & current VV locations
  * Integrate with Nashville bus system to see buses and routes for nashville!

Campus Maps
  * It would be great if the VU stationary "you are here" maps around the campus had a note about downloading a live map. It would make it easier to get around once you left the map stand.


Health
    * Health Plus is the VU free gym. It would be great to have their current class schedule and updates as an app.
