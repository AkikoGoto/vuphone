= User Stories =

Users can:
Map: Guy
 * see a map of campus
 * pan and zoom the map using single- and multi-touch gestures
 * see the app decked out with a Vanderbilt color scheme
Layers: Ben
 * tap a button from the map view that will display the list of layers
 * select a layer from a list of layers to display on the map
 * see the location markers on a layer
 * hide or show multiple layers from a list of layers
Handles marker taps: Demetri
 * tap a location's marker to see title
 * tap a location marker's title to see the following details: title, description, coordinate
 * see the annotation's details formatted as a list
 * see an image related to annotation selected when viewing the annotation's details

Locations: Joshua
 * see a search interface for the location
 * search for a location by name
 * browse a list of locations
NOTE: somebody needs to work on the data model while others work on the UI separately, and they need to be merged

Users would love to eventually at some distant point in the future:
 * rotate the device to reorient the map into portrait or landscape orientation
 * see a compass rose that always points north
 * see a help layer when the app is first launched
 * add to the campus-wide list of locations
 * see context-sensitive details for supported locations
 * find the shortest path between any two points or buildings
 * find the shortest path from their current location to a location at or near Vanderbilt
 * see the locations of their courses on the map
 * see the locations of specific friends who are also using the app on the map
 * see the estimated occupancy of a building or rooms within a building
