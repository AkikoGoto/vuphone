 * select a layer from a list of layers to display on the map
 * see the location markers on a layer => Ben
 * hide or show multiple layers from a list of layers

 * find the shortest path from their current location to a location at or near Vanderbilt => Joshua
 * see the locations of their courses on the map
 * see the locations of specific friends who are also using the app on the map
 * see the estimated occupancy of a building or rooms within a building
