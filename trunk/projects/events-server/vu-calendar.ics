SUMMARY:Tennessee Rep presents A Christmas Story

Ralphie pleads his case before his mother\, his teacher and even Santa Claus himself\, at Goldblatt's Department Store. The consistent response\: "You'll shoot your eye out."

SUMMARY:Author Talk and Book Signing at Scarritt-Bennett's Gallery F
DESCRIPTION:Scarritt-Bennett Center will host author Margery L. Mayer as she speaks about and signs her new book\, Repairers of the Breach\: Memoirs of a Missionary - Nagasaki\, Japan 1948-1951.\nCopies of the book will be available to purchase. Light refreshments will be served. The event will begin at 3 p.m.\, and Mayer will speak at 3\:30 p.m.\nABOUT Repairers of the Breach\:\nThree years after graduating from college and the end of World War II\, Margery Mayer - now a resident of Brentwood\, Tenn. - joined a group of 50 young people sent to Japan by the Methodist Church in an effort called "The Fellowship of Reconstruction." The purpose was to live for three years with young Japanese and work toward tearing down the wall of fear\, hate and hostility that had grown between Japan and the U.S.\, and to rebuild a new world of peace.\nMayer was sent to Kwassui Girls School in Nagasaki\, where she had many discussions with her students about Christianity and democracy. Repairers of the Breach is the story of their lives together -- Japanese students and a young American missionary -- the impact it had on each\, and the bonding that took place as they worked toward a new world of peace.

SUMMARY:At the Frist\: Off the Wall Lecture Series "The Surrealist Literary Movement in Paris"
DESCRIPTION:You have seen Twilight Visions\: Surrealism\, Photography\, and Paris and delved into the minds of the Surrealists. Now learn more about the tumultuous yet edifying times they lived in by attending the Frist Center&#39\;s three-part Off the Wall lecture series being held in conjunction with the exhibition. In the early twentieth century\, Surrealist writers such as Andr&eacute\; Breton [abreton.htm]\, Louis Aragon [aragon.htm]\, and Paul &Eacute\;luard [http\://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/eluard.htm]   envisioned the city of Paris as an interactive playground for literary experimentation and an exploration of the unconscious.\nDr. Lisa Weiss\, assistant director of the W. T. Bandy Center for Baudelaire and Modern French Studies and lecturer in French at Vanderbilt University\, will address the literary roots of Surrealism and consider how the movement&#39\;s poetry and prose intersect with the city&#39\;s urban landscape and everyday life.
