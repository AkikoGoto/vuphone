Four students will also talk about their experiences from their various viewpoints. Students come home with a new interest in the roots of our worship practices and a renewed sense of calling as pastors and worship leaders. The blending of time for spiritual reflection\, opportunities for communal worship\, and a connection to the rich history of worship (starting with the beginnings of modern Western liturgy in the twelfth century at Old Sarum) offers unique possibilities for growth. One student remarked\, "My understanding of worship will never be the same\; my life has changed."\nBreakfast $10\nReservations Necessary\nPlease RSVP to (615) 936-8453 or register online at www.vanderbilt.edu/divinity  [http\://www.vanderbilt.edu/divinity ](click "Events")\nby November 16\, 2009.\nLocation\: Divinity School (Google map of this location [http\://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=101764828845341185184.000001134545125f0a96e&t=k&z=19&om=1])\n

SUMMARY:Off the Wall Lecture Series\: "RE-ASSEMBLING REALITY\: Surrealism and Surrealist Film in 1920s and 1930s Paris"
DESCRIPTION:You have seen Twilight Visions\: Surrealism\, Photography\, and Paris and delved into the minds of the Surrealists. Now learn more about the tumultuous yet edifying times they lived in by attending the Frist Center's three part Off the Wall lecture series being held in conjunction with the exhibition. Kelli Shay Hix\, moving image archivist at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum\, will discuss the techniques and goals of the creators of selected early Parisian Surrealist films\, as well as the history behind their works.\n  Location\: Frist Center (Directions [http\://www.fristcenter.org/site/visit/])\nThe postÂWorld War I Parisian Surrealists used the mediums of writing\, painting\, and photography to expose the "superior reality of certain forms of previously neglected associations." But it was the medium of moving image film which gave the Surrealists the opportunity to create a nearly complete parallel world in which reason took a backseat to dreams\, and in which traditional editing processes were used to confuse\, rather than to clarify\, normal patterns of reason. Though entertaining\, these films are far from escapist. Much of the meaning in the films relies on the viewers' expectations\, reactions\, and interpretations of the films. This cinema is not meant to re-enact dreams or to tell a narrative\, but to acknowledge a reality "outside of all aesthetic and moral preoccupation."\n*Quotes are from The Surrealist Manifesto\, Andr&eacute\; Breton\, 1924\n

SUMMARY:Tennessee Rep presents A Christmas Story
DESCRIPTION:Humorist Jean Shepherd's memoir of growing up in the Midwest in the 1940s follows 9-year-old Ralphie Parker in his unflappable campaign to get Santa (or anyone else) to give him a Red Ryder carbine-action\, 200 shot range-model air rifle. Ralphie pleads his case before his mother\, his teacher and even Santa Claus himself\, at Goldblatt's Department Store. The consistent response\: "You'll shoot your eye out." All the elements from the beloved motion picture are here\, including the family's temperamental exploding furnace\; Scut Farkas\, the school bully\; the boys' experiment with a wet tongue on a cold lamppost\; the Little Orphan Annie decoder pin\; Ralphie's father winning a lamp shaped like a woman's leg in a net stocking\; Ralphie's fantasy scenarios and more. This irresistible piece of Americana is a cult classic and is guaranteed to warm the heart and tickle the funny bone.\nTicket required\, click for details [http\://tennesseerep.org/09_10%20subscription_info.php]\nLocation\:  Johnson Theater\, TPAC (Directions [http\://www.tpac.org/visiting/directions.asp])\n
