DESCRIPTION:“Parietal-frontal networks in the primate brain that support actions”\nOmar Gharbawie\, Ph.D.\nVanderbilt University\nDepartment of Psychology/Kaas Lab\nAbstract\:\nThe extension of the ‘dorsal stream’ linking posterior parietal cortex and motor/premotor cortex is involved in visuomotor transformations for reaching and grasping. Specific functions of the putative anatomical connections remain poorly understood\, however. This report is part of a series focused on relating parietal-frontal connections to neurophysiological functions in New World monkeys. Anatomical results will demonstrate that largely segregated connections within the parietal-frontal network support actions\, including reaching and grasping.\nThursday\, December 3\, 2009\n12\:10 p.m.\n316 Wilson Hall\nAbstract\nDepartment of Psychology NEUROSCIENCE SEMINAR SERIES\nFor additional information\, contact Carol Wiley@carol.wiley@vanderbilt.edu [javascript\:location.href='mailto\:'+String.fromCharCode(99\,97\,114\,111\,108\,46\,119\,105\,108\,101\,121\,64\,118\,97\,110\,100\,101\,114\,98\,105\,108\,116\,46\,101\,100\,117)+'?']\n

SUMMARY:Author Talk and Book Signing at Scarritt-Bennett's Gallery F
DESCRIPTION:Scarritt-Bennett Center will host author Margery L. Mayer as she speaks about and signs her new book\, Repairers of the Breach\: Memoirs of a Missionary - Nagasaki\, Japan 1948-1951.\nCopies of the book will be available to purchase. Light refreshments will be served. The event will begin at 3 p.m.\, and Mayer will speak at 3\:30 p.m.\nABOUT Repairers of the Breach\:\nThree years after graduating from college and the end of World War II\, Margery Mayer - now a resident of Brentwood\, Tenn. - joined a group of 50 young people sent to Japan by the Methodist Church in an effort called "The Fellowship of Reconstruction." The purpose was to live for three years with young Japanese and work toward tearing down the wall of fear\, hate and hostility that had grown between Japan and the U.S.\, and to rebuild a new world of peace.\nMayer was sent to Kwassui Girls School in Nagasaki\, where she had many discussions with her students about Christianity and democracy. Repairers of the Breach is the story of their lives together -- Japanese students and a young American missionary -- the impact it had on each\, and the bonding that took place as they worked toward a new world of peace.

SUMMARY:At the Frist\: Off the Wall Lecture Series "The Surrealist Literary Movement in Paris"
DESCRIPTION:You have seen Twilight Visions\: Surrealism\, Photography\, and Paris and delved into the minds of the Surrealists. Now learn more about the tumultuous yet edifying times they lived in by attending the Frist Center&#39\;s three-part Off the Wall lecture series being held in conjunction with the exhibition. In the early twentieth century\, Surrealist writers such as Andr&eacute\; Breton [abreton.htm]\, Louis Aragon [aragon.htm]\, and Paul &Eacute\;luard [http\://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/eluard.htm]   envisioned the city of Paris as an interactive playground for literary experimentation and an exploration of the unconscious.\nDr. Lisa Weiss\, assistant director of the W. T. Bandy Center for Baudelaire and Modern French Studies and lecturer in French at Vanderbilt University\, will address the literary roots of Surrealism and consider how the movement&#39\;s poetry and prose intersect with the city&#39\;s urban landscape and everyday life.

DESCRIPTION:Free and open to the public\nPresented by\: Helena Simonett\, Assistant Professor of Latin American Studies\, Adjunct Assistant Professor of Music Literature and History\, Blair School of Music\nMexico\, France\, Netherlands\, Germany (2007) Dir\: Carlos Reygadas.\nThis deeply affecting drama\, performed by a cast of mostly nonprofessional actors\, reveals the everyday raptures of an isolated Mennonite community in northern Mexico. Johan\, a farmer with seven towheaded children and a devoted wife\, Esther\, has fallen in love with a neighbor\, Marianne.

SUMMARY:The Department of Microbiology & Immunology Seminar Series\: Dr. Mark R. Denison
DESCRIPTION:“Bats\, Bat-SARS\, and Emerging Infections\: Culprit or Innocent Bystander?”\nPresenter\: Mark R. Denison\, M.D.\, Professor of Pediatrics\, Associate Professor of Microbiology & Immunology\nAbstract\: There is increasing recognition that Bats harbor viruses known or predicted to infect humans or oSave [https\://sitemason.vanderbilt.edu/members/interface/bzrandu#]ther animals\, including coronaviruses\, flaviviruses\, alphaviruses\, rhabdoviruses and paramyxoviruses. The vast biological diversity of bats and their unique colonial and behavioral characteristics among mammals make them potential important vectors for the evolution and inter-species transmission of viruses. SARS-coronavirus is closely related to novel bat coronaviruses\, from which it may have originated. Pathways for emergence have been difficult to study in prospective replication or experimental evolution experiments due to the inability to cultivate bat viruses. We have used synthetic biology recover a viable bat coronavirus and test the determinants of host range\, replication and pathogenesis. The seminar will discuss the unique biology of bats and relevance of bats to the evolution of human viruses\, and will describe our synthetic recovery and testing of a bat coronavirus to define determinants of zoonotic-human host-species movement of coronaviruses.\nHosted by\: The Department of Microbiology & Immunology\n

DESCRIPTION:Free and Open to the Public\nDowntown Nashville Public Library (Directions [http\://www.library.nashville.org/locations/loc_all.asp])\nVideo of this event will be available from VUCAST\, http\://www.vanderbilt.edu/news [http\://www.vanderbilt.edu/news]\, after the event\nConversations with David Wood\, Centennial Professor of Philosophy\, Vanderbilt University\n"Voices From Our America"\nIfeoma C.K. Nwankwo [http\://www.vanderbilt.edu/vio/node/361]\, Associate Professor of English\nDr. Nwankwo will share new insights and information gained through the work of her Voices from Our America project. As a contribution to the realization of the robustly democratic America envisioned and called for by humanists such as Langston Hughes\, Frederick Douglass\, and John Blassingame.\nThe Voices from Our America project uncovers previously inaudible\, silenced\, or neglected American voices to facilitate cross-cultural and cross-generational conversation and to make these exchanges a fundamental part of K-12\, collegiate\, graduate\, and community education in the U.S. and Panama. It does so by generating novel methods and venues by and through which students\, faculty\, community members\, and institutional stakeholders can work collaboratively to advance local and hemispheric knowledge\, connectedness\, and cooperation.\nBox lunches will be provided for the the first 300 people to respond. Call 322-8585 to RSVP by December 7\, 2009.\nComplimentary luncheon series sponsored by Vanderbilt University and Nashville Public Library.

SUMMARY:Tennessee Rep presents A Christmas Story
DESCRIPTION:Humorist Jean Shepherd's memoir of growing up in the Midwest in the 1940s follows 9-year-old Ralphie Parker in his unflappable campaign to get Santa (or anyone else) to give him a Red Ryder carbine-action\, 200 shot range-model air rifle. Ralphie pleads his case before his mother\, his teacher and even Santa Claus himself\, at Goldblatt's Department Store. The consistent response\: "You'll shoot your eye out." All the elements from the beloved motion picture are here\, including the family's temperamental exploding furnace\; Scut Farkas\, the school bully\; the boys' experiment with a wet tongue on a cold lamppost\; the Little Orphan Annie decoder pin\; Ralphie's father winning a lamp shaped like a woman's leg in a net stocking\; Ralphie's fantasy scenarios and more.

SUMMARY:Tennessee Rep presents A Christmas Story
DESCRIPTION:Humorist Jean Shepherd's memoir of growing up in the Midwest in the 1940s follows 9-year-old Ralphie Parker in his unflappable campaign to get Santa (or anyone else) to give him a Red Ryder carbine-action\, 200 shot range-model air rifle. Ralphie pleads his case before his mother\, his teacher and even Santa Claus himself\, at Goldblatt's Department Store. The consistent response\: "You'll shoot your eye out." All the elements from the beloved motion picture are here\, including the family's temperamental exploding furnace\; Scut Farkas\, the school bully\; the boys' experiment with a wet tongue on a cold lamppost\; the Little Orphan Annie decoder pin\; Ralphie's father winning a lamp shaped like a woman's leg in a net stocking\; Ralphie's fantasy scenarios and more. This irresistible piece of Americana is a cult classic and is guaranteed to warm the heart and tickle the funny bone.\n  Ticket required\, click for details [http\://tennesseerep.org/09_10%20subscription_info.php]\n   Location\:  Johnson Theater\, TPAC (Directions [http\://www.tpac.org/visiting/directions.asp])\n

SUMMARY:Tennessee Rep presents A Christmas Story
DESCRIPTION:Humorist Jean Shepherd's memoir of growing up in the Midwest in the 1940s follows 9-year-old Ralphie Parker in his unflappable campaign to get Santa (or anyone else) to give him a Red Ryder carbine-action\, 200 shot range-model air rifle. Ralphie pleads his case before his mother\, his teacher and even Santa Claus himself\, at Goldblatt's Department Store. The consistent response\: "You'll shoot your eye out." All the elements from the beloved motion picture are here\, including the family's temperamental exploding furnace\; Scut Farkas\, the school bully\; the boys' experiment with a wet tongue on a cold lamppost\; the Little Orphan Annie decoder pin\; Ralphie's father winning a lamp shaped like a woman's leg in a net stocking\; Ralphie's fantasy scenarios and more. This irresistible piece of Americana is a cult classic and is guaranteed to warm the heart and tickle the funny bone.\n  Ticket required\, click for details [http\://tennesseerep.org/09_10%20subscription_info.php]\n   Location\:  Johnson Theater\, TPAC (Directions [http\://www.tpac.org/visiting/directions.asp])\n
